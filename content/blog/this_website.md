A little spiel on how and why I made this website.

# A website! How?

With ease.

I've made a personal website before actually. I crafted it out of raw html and css, no frameworks, or whatever, just as Tim Berners-Lee intended. 

$$ \frac{2}{3} $$

This time around I wanted things to 
1. Just be plain easier to code, so I actually *use* the damn thing
2. Feel a bit more... put together

So I made this website using Hugo, the docs for which leave a *little* to be desired in terms of a tutorial - it's sort of like "so here's how to install themes and make content - right! That's all! Have fun wandering round the other doc pages slowly piecing everything else together!". Whatever. I got it working easily enough.

~Future me can pick this up, I might edit the CSS, which would certainly change the content of this article~

# A website :eyes:!? Why?

I needed a place to document my projects. I plan to make YouTube videos on them too, but videos are effort. Writing little posts is much easier (plus it acts as a sort of draft for the video script - two turds with one bone!).

I also wanted a place to share some writings. Mini-essays of sorts. I realised I should write more - get the thoughts out there - *distill things*. I've got a post coming up about teaching fractions, decimals, and division of them to children, motivated by my struggle trying to teach said topics to my little cousin.


And finally, like the home page ~says~ (will say):

> "I ask, 'cause I'm not sure, do anybody make real shit anymore?" - K. West, *Stronger*

Social media just ain't got the **vibe**. Same profile layout, same black background (because you're not *seriously* using Instagram in light mode are you?) - it's a damn shame. That's part of the reason I whacked this thing on [Neocities](https://neocities.org/browse) (also because it's free): you see some real creativity from some real deranged people on there - *just as Tim Berners-Lee intended*. Webpages should contain knowledge and vibes, not slop.
