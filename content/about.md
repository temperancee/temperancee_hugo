My name is Myles, I'm a third year mathematics and statistics student at Durham University who spends his time building robots and programming things (e.g. robots, but not *just* robots). I'm currently spending a year working as an Operational Researcher in the Civil Service, helping to develop a static microsimulation model.

On this website you can expect to find documentation of my projects, as well as some more general blog posts relating to programming, robotics, maths, Vim, Linux, and whatever else.

Enjoy your stay.
