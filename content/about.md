My name is Myles, but I'm floating temperancee as my latest (and greatest) screen name.

I'm a third year mathematics student who spends his time building robots and programming things (like robots, but not *just* robots). 

On this website you can expect to find documentation of my projects, as well as some more general blog posts relating to programming, robotics, Vim, Linux, maths, and whatever else.

Enjoy your stay.
